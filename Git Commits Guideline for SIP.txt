To keep a consistent workflow in the project please refer to this link:

Having a consistent workflow can reduce confusion and keep the project 
nice and clean, if you are still not familiar with git I suggest you 
that you read on it as soon as possible.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

To keep the commits readable and understandable, try and commit in reasonable
sections and keep the commit messages as informative as you can but at the 
same time not too overly complicated.

GIT Commit Message Format:

< Git commit summary > ( Keep this informative but simple )

< Git commit description > ( Put as much information as you can over here, 
                             though keep it organised)

< Changes summary in bullet form > ( Use stars or hyphens as bullets,
                                     list changes)

Example:

Added Commit CPU

This CPU helps you commit everytime you apply a redstone signal and a book.
A very requested feature since CPU 1.0

*Added Commit CPU type
*Added type to typifier
*Supports Github
*LOL
